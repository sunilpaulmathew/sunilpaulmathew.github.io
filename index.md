<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Welcome to my homepage. I am <strong>Dr. Sunil</strong>, a researcher who is born and brought up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala" target="_blank">Kerala</a>, a southern state of India which is regarded as one of the most beautiful places on this planet. I am currently working at <a href="https://www.czu.cz/en/" target="_blank">Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CULS)</a>, also known as Česká zemědělská univerzita v Praze (CZU), Czech Republic, as a Postdoctoral Researcher. I have been working on various aspects of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences for the last few years. I have strong research interests in Analytical Chemistry (e.g. chromatography and mass spectrometry), Physical Chemistry (e.g. reaction mechanism and kinetics), Environmental chemistry (e.g. screening and removal of pollutants, environmentally relevant chemical transformations in frozen phase) etc. Besides my research activities, I am also interested in Linux & Android, Photography, Photo-designing, Traveling, Music, Sports etc.</tab1></p>

* Characterization of isomeric compounds by Energy-Resolved Mass Spectrometry.
* Trace level detection of organic pollutants by tandem Mass Spectrometry.
* Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) for the degradation of organic pollutants from water.
* Chemical transformations in frozen phase.
* Fast radical kinetics.
