<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Welcome to my homepage. I'm <strong>Dr. Sunil</strong>, a researcher who is born and brought up in Kerala, a southern state of India which is regarded as one of the most beautiful places on this planet. I'm currently working at <a href="http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/" target="_blank">Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)</a>, Pohang, Republic of Korea, as a Postdoctoral Researcher. I have been working on various aspects of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences for the last few years. I have strong research interests in Analytical Chemistry (e.g. chromatography and mass spectrometry), Physical Chemistry (e.g. reaction mechanism and kinetics), Environmental Remediation (e.g. screening and removal of pollutants), Ice chemistry (e.g. chemical transformations in ice phase) etc.</tab1></p>
