<h3 style="text-align: center;">February 1, 2018</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>I'll be on vacation (and busy with travel) for the next three weeks. I will not have access to my build environment during the whole period. That means I have no way to update any of my projects (including Kernel, Apps etc.) during the mentioned period. Of course, I'll try to read all the messages whenever I got time and internet access.</tab1></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>I'll really appreciate if someone from this community could spend the time to update my source, build and share kernel's with the rest during this period. It won't be a big deal for anyone willing since all of my sources are nicely maintained and significantly straightforward. Please visit the respective GitHub pages for more information.</tab1></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Bye for now... & enjoy my absence...</p>
